# Naming Conventions/Styles For Things Related To Git

_This only applies to Git so do not use this for anything else._

## Branches

- Use snake_case for git branches. Using kebab-case is also acceptable but snake_case is **strongly** preferred.
- Be as concise as possible with your git branch name.
  - Exercise common sense.

## Commits

- Start your commit message's title with a verb (in simple present tense).
- Try to summarize as much of what you did as possible in the title of the commit message. If this is not possible, then you can include the parts you didn't cover in the body (this is not mandatory, however).
- The body of the commit message need not be written at all, it can be empty. Use it when you feel the need to elaborate on what you did in your commit.

## Pull Requests

- Start your PR message's title with a verb (in simple present tense).
- Since PRs can have one or more commits, the title should reflect the overall goal/objective you are trying to achieve with your commit(s).
- The body of the PR message can be empty as there is no requirement on writing anything for it. Use it when you feel the need to elaborate on what you did in your PR.
