# Date Time Library To Use

Use **date-fns** for any of your date time needs. Do not use **moment.js** or any other DateTime library, nor should you directly use the DateTime API offered by JS/TS.

We used to have moment.js as our main DateTime library, but switched to date-fns for very good reasons that can be found [here](https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Momentjs).

## Use date-fns please!
